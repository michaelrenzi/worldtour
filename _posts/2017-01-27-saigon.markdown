Disclaimer: Although we know that the city's actual name is Ho Chi Minh City, we will refer to it as Saigon from here on out because it is a much sweeter name and everyone there calls it Saigon anyway.

Sad to say that today is our last in Vietnam, but Saigon might have been the best possible way to send us off. This city was absolutely massive, so there was virtually no end to options of things to do while we were here. The markets here were huge -- they literally had a flower market that took up an entire 3-block park -- we had some of the best Vietnamese food of our trip, and the city was also home to the best rooftop bars we've ever been to (even though the only beer some of them had was Budweiser, or "American piss" as one Australian put it). Another highlight: we got a traditional Vietnamese massage during our stay, and even not being huge massage people, we both agreed this was by far the best we've ever had -- there's something to be said about a 90-pound Vietnamese woman standing and jumping on your back.

We didn't see as many temples here as we did in Hanoi and Danang, but there were a ton of exhibits and activities around the city revolving around the history of the Vietnam War. We went to their War Remnants Musuem on our first day, which had a lot of the US weapons and vehicles that were captured by the Vietnamese during the War, along with multiple collections of photos taken by both US and Vietnamese photographers. We can't say we really remember too many details about the war from high school (sorry NDA), but it was really interesting to see everything from the Vietnamese perspective and learn more about that time in history. A couple of days later, we did a trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels, about two hours north of Saigon, which is one of the villages in which the Viet Cong built a network of underground tunnels that they used to hide and combat against the Americans. Our tourguide gave us a lot of good information on how they used the tunnels and some of their tactics, and also let us crawl through one of the tunnels (which was about three feet tall and barely large enough for us to crawl through).

With all of this as well as our stays in Hanoi and Danang, we both agree that Vietnam has to be one of the coolest countries we have ever visited. The amount of culture there was astounding and fascinating, the people we met there were some of the friendliest we've come across in all of our travels thus far, and we may or may not have eaten our weight in noodles and rice along with the other amazing dishes offered throughout the country. We are a little sad to say goodbye, but are beyond excited for our next stop in Cambodia.
