We finally got around to posting our NZ pictures! Sorry if people just thought we fell of the face of the earth after Australia or just decided not to go. Our stay in NZ was just under two weeks so we combined Queenstown and Wellington into one post.

We started off in Queenstown, which is located towards the southern tip of the South Island. The town is located on a crystal clear, aqua blue lake called Lake Wakatipu which was formed by glacial processes and is surrounded by multiple, incredible mountain ranges (the mountain range closest to town is literally called the Remarkables). Because of this absolutely stunning and unique scenery, Queenstown is known as being the "Global Adventure Capital" of the world and definitely lives up to its reputation. Any crazy outdoor activity you can dream up probably started in Queenstown (don't worry parents we did not do anything too crazy). The locals and tourists alike come to this part of the country to be outside and experience the breathtaking scenery. The first few days we were there, we took advantage of the beautiful weather and went on a full day hike up the Ben Lomond Trail, which looks back down onto Queenstown and off onto the many mountain ranges in the distance. We also spent a day touring the famous Fiordland National Park and Milford Sound. Lucky for us, our friends from back home, Logan and Pete, arrived into town so we all got to explore together! The next two days were rainy and foggy, and the mountains were completely covered, so we stayed local and explored the town and vineyards around the area. Wine making is relatively new to the area, so the vineyards were super small, which allowed us to walk around most of the vineyard and explore how and where they produce and make the wine. Coolest winery by far was Gibbston Valley Wines, which had this unique wine cave that was built into the side of a mountain and was where they stored all of the wine without the need for refrigeration. We also ate at the famous Fergburger (not once but twice) and would have eaten there more if the lines were not out the door 24/7. 

After saying goodbye to Logan, Pete and Queenstown, we flew to Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Any Lord of the Rings fans out there would greatly appreciate visiting this city. We did not do a full tour to see all of the spots where the film was shot, but did get to visit the Weta Cave, which is the company that created much of the set design, armor and costumes, make-up and special effects for all the movies. We also hiked up the famous Mount Victoria that looks back over Wellington and stopped by the spot where they filmed Frodo and company barely escaped being seen by the black riders. It took us forever to find in the woods but we finally did and it was worth the journey. Since it is the capital, Wellington also offered a lot of really well done museums; perhaps some of the best we have ever been to (sorry DC). One museum had the largest squid ever caught on display, the eye alone was the size of a soccer ball. After all of the traveling we had done, Wellington was a calm and relaxing city to enjoy before heading back home and to reality.

Thanks to everyone who followed us during out trip! It was definitely one of the most unreal and amazing experiences we have ever had and we really appreciated everyone reaching out during our trip to check-in. We definitely can't wait to plan our next adventure.
