Hello! Today marks our last day in Australia, as we make our way to New Zealand today. When we originally came up with the idea to take this trip, one of the places that we knew would be a highlight was Sydney, as I (Mike) had lived here for about five months while studying abroad and deesperately wanted both to go back and to show Meagan what an amazing city Sydney is. I think that, at this point, it's safe to say that my love for Sydney was reaffirmed over the last five days and that Meagan is right on board with me.

The great thing about Sydney is you really don't need to leave the city to find all the options you would need to have an amazing time. We stayed right by Darling Harbour, which has some of the best views of the extremely impressive skyline of Sydney, so we spent a lot of time there, and we also spent a fair bit of time at Sydney Harbour, home to both the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. Other days, we took the ferries that spread throughout the Sydney area to go to the Australian Open surf competition at Manley Beach, the Taronga Zoo (one of the best zoo's out there), and Watson's Bay, where the waterway that runs into Sydney Harbour meets the Pacific Ocean. Another highlight was visiting the beaches right outside Sydney; we did the coastal walk from Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach one day, which was essentially a walking version of the Great Ocean Road in Melbourne (though obviously without as many sights and stops).

We also had a chance to go to some of my old favorite food spots in Sydney, and I am happy to say that all of them lived up to the wait of seven years. The number one spot among these was the Australian Hotel, home to over 100 Australian beers as well as the famous Kangaroo Pizza (for those of you who don't know, a "hotel" in Australia often refers to a pub). We went here on our second day in Sydney, and by the end of the stay felt we needed to visit again, so we actually did this one twice. The second stop we were compelled to go to was the famous Pancakes on the Rocks restaurant, which is a 24/7 pancake restaurant that serves insane combinations of pancakes/ice cream. We actually made the stop there this morning and I'm pretty sure we both are still feeling the effects; luckily we'll be able to pass out in our food coma pretty soon when we board up for Queenstown.

All this to say: our stay in Sydney was everything we are hoping for, and for anyone thinking of visiting Australia, this is a stop you simply cannot miss (though this was most likely obvious before). It's always sad to leave such an amazing place, but we are excited to make our way to the last country of our trip!
