After traveling through so many bustling cities, our next stop on the Phi Phi islands in Thailand was much needed. The islands are in southern Thailand, about an hour off the coast of Krabi. We stayed on the largest of the islands, called Ko Phi Phi Don. Much of our time there was spent hanging out on the beach or walking around the town (which consisted mostly of restaurants, bars and gift shops). We tried to stay away from most of the bars, as they were filled with spring breakers, but we did stop by one bar to check out the Thai boxing that everyone had told us about. Before the actual Thia boxers came out, they asked for volunteers from the crowd to come up and try. Suprisingly enough, there we enough of those spring breakers in the crowd that we ended up watching tourist-boxing for a while. We then watched the Thai boxers afterwards. At one point both of them flew between the ropes out of the ring and almost crashed into one of the tables at the bar; it was insanely intense.

We decided to rent a kayak for one day as well to explore some of the more secluded parts of the island. We were told it was a quick 15 minute trip to Loh Lana Bay, which the locals said had the best beach, and quickly discovered it was much much farther. By the time we were exhausted from paddling, we were too stubborn to turn back so we continued and finally made it about an hour later. As the locals had promised, it ended up being worth the trip. There were maybe 15 other people on the beach with us; no hotels or restaurants, just a lady selling water from a make-shift stand. After hanging out on the beach for a while, we decided to try our luck and hike across to the other side of the island where all of the 5-star resorts are located. To our suprise, we kept it cool and were able to grab some lounge chairs right on the beach. No doubt we definitely stood out since we did not have their towels, but nobody came to kick us out so for a few hours we got to enjoy the good life.

On one of our other day trips, we took a tour of Ko Phi Phi Leh island, which is known for the famous Maya Bay. For all of the Leo D. fans out there, you might recognize this place from one of his blockbuster hits, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beach/">The Beach</a>. The boat dropped us off at the bay for a few hours, where we got to swim and snorkle, then drove us around to some of the other coves. At one point our driver stopped the boat in the middle of one of the larger coves, which was almost completely surrounded by huge rocks jutting out from the water, and told us in broken english "we stop, you swim" and with that we all did as he said and jumped off the sides of the boats to swim. The water here was especially clear and warm; probably one of the most amazing places we have ever seen.

Now, after a few days relaxing on the beach and getting sufficiently crisped, we are off to Singapore!
