<p class="lead"><img src="img/budapest.jpg" alt="Mike and Meagan" style="margin: 5px; float:right; width:130px" />Hello friends! </p>

<p>As we may have already told many of you, we will be travelling through Southeast Asia and Australia/New Zealand from January to March, and we wanted to have a way of keeping folks updated without being obnoxious on social media. We are hoping to see an insane variety of world wonders, from some of the largest temple complexes on the planet and <a href="http://www.jamesbondisland.com/">James Bond Island</a> in Thailand, to the Great Barrier Reef before its untimely demise (thanks, humanity), so hopefully you will find at least one interesting thing here that makes it worth following. For a full list of the places we'll be going, check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/map">Maps</a> page.</p>
<p>We will try to update the website as frequently as we can whenever we have wifi, so if you are interested in seeing some pics (particularly lots of selfies) and reading deep insights of enlightenment from our travels, be sure to check back here! If you need to get in touch with us, FB messenger is always good, but we also included info on other ways to contact us on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/posts">Posts</a> page.</p>
<p>Peace out America and see you in March! Good luck with the inauguration.<p>
<p><strong>Mike & Meagan</strong></p>
